## Overview
The purpose of this project was to created a prototype that provided information about Ionic and Covalent bonds. This prototype was built for mobile (Android-based) virtual reality headsets that utilize two controllers.

## How to Use
- Navigate to the center of the room where the two Element Dispensers are located.
- Point either controller towards the consoles that are showing the available Elements.
- Click on an Element to spawn the atom; the Element will be highlighted on the Periodic Table of Elements on the wall.
- When both Dispensers have an atom active, a list of available compounds the active Elements can produce will show.
- A question will appear at the bottom asking whether the displayed compound is Ionic or Covalent.
- Select one of the options: correct answers will highlight in green, incorrect answers in red.
